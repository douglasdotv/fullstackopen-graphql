This repository contains a library app developed during [Full Stack Open Part 8](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part8).

The project explores GraphQL as an alternative to REST for communication between frontend and backend. It features a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server, integrated with an Express HTTP server, and a MongoDB database for data storage. React is used on the frontend with Apollo Client to handle queries and mutations.
